# CIFAR10
CIFAR10-ObjectDetection with ResNet50 achieves 83.2% accuracy on the test set &amp; 89.5% on the train set

CIFAR-10 contains images of 10 classes which need to be classified

The images are low resolution 32*32 rgb images making the task even difficult

The .ipynb file contains implementation of ResNet50 inspired architecture

It achieves 83.2% accuracy on the test set after 20 epochs but is subject a bit of variation each time due to the randomness involved in Stochastic Gradient descent
